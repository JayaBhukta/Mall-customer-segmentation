                                              **Mall customer segmentation**
                                               
**📌Steps Performed :**

📍Imported all the necessary libraries and loaded the dataset.  
📍Performed Exploratory Data analysis and remove little outliers.  
📍Used heatmap visualisation to find most relevent variables.   
📍After getting the most relevant features from the previous step, trained the unsupervised learning model with knn clustering algorithm.  
📍Found optimal number of clusters through Elbow method 📉. 
📍Further trained the model several time increasing the number of parameters to get best accuracy.  
📍Created 2D & 3D scatterplot with different colours for better identification of clusters and plotted centeroids for each cluster.  
📍Applied the variance checking method for finding parameters with higher importance.  
📍Compared the trained model based on no. of parameters and converted the comparison report into pandas dataframe and barchart for better understanding & visualisation.📊
